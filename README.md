<code> We created a Country, State, and City Management Application using React and Vite without relying on heavy frameworks like create-react-app. 
The goal was to build a lightweight, scalable application that allows users to add, edit, and delete countries, states, and cities in a hierarchical structure. 
We started by setting up a minimal React project using only the necessary npm modules (react, react-dom, and vite).
We manually created the folder structure and files, including App.js for the main logic, CountryList.js, StateList.js, and CityList.js for managing the hierarchical data, and index.html as the entry point. 
We used React's useState hook to manage the application's state and implemented functions for adding, editing, and deleting entities. Finally, we added custom CSS for a clean and modern design. 
The application was built step-by-step via the terminal, ensuring a lightweight and efficient setup. This approach allowed us to avoid unnecessary dependencies and keep the project simple and maintainable.</code>
